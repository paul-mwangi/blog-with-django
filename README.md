  <h2>WHY A BLOG</h2>
    <p> It seems like everyone recreate a blog as their first application. Well, there is a reason for that, first of all. Everyone knows how a blog works and this make it easy for learning. When I tell you we are creating a blog, you automatically know that there is some sort of authentication system, posts are going to be the main element, there will be a page that list all the post in a particular order e.g chronologically and you also know each of these post will have comments.

Simply put, when we say a blog, you are able to visualize the end goal of the tutorial and everyone is on the same page as to what a blog entails. I think those are the main reason why a blog application? and the other important reason is, it does not involve anything overly complex but at the same time it will get you into some of the most important element of software development and this will act as a stepping stone for any application in the future.<p><br>
